# New-York-City-Bike-Traffic-Data-Analysis

In this college project, I use data science concepts and my analytical skills to effectively derive conclusions to the following questions:

1. I want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But I only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should I install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?

2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast to predict the number of bicyclists that day?

3. Can I use this data to predict whether it is raining based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?

This project has two sections: code and the report. The report gives a detailed explanation as to why I chose that specific data science concept (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, Logistic Regression etc.), the results that I obtained and the conclusions I made from it. 

For this project, I worked on Jupyter Notebook.
